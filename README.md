## Who am I?
I'm a student currently studying [Computer Science][] at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology][ntnu].
I've always liked programming, and had a few personal projects even before I started studying. I like to program chess
to learn a new programming language, which is why you'll see a couple different chess projects on my profile, like for
[rust][] and [java][].
