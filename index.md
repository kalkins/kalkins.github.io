# About me
My name is Sindre Stephansen, I'm 19 years old, and I'm currently studying [Computer Science][] at the
[Norwegian University of Science and Technology][ntnu](NTNU).
I've always liked programming, and had a few personal projects even before I started studying. I like to program chess
to learn a new programming language, which is why you'll see a couple different chess projects on my profile, like for
[rust][] and [java][].

On my spare time I'm playing the clarinet in [Bispehaugen Ungdomskorps][buk], where I'm also responsible for the webpage
and server.

I'm also a member of [Hackerspace NTNU][hs], which is a student driven organization that gives students access to technology they
wouldn't otherwise have, like 3D-printing and VR-headsets. We also teach courses in arduino, rasberry pi, soldering, and more.
I'm currently a part of a subgroup of hackerspace that's building an escape room, where we have many puzzles created with the
technology we have learnt at hackerspace.

# Previous projects
I've been working on a few projects the last years. Here are a some you might find interesting.

## Chess in Rust
[This is the first of the chess games][rust]. I had heard some good things about rust, and I wanted to give it a try.
After looking through some introductory tutorials I wanted to combine everything I had learnt about the language, and
see how the different parts worked together. To do this i chose to implement chess. You may not have thought about it,
but chess has a lot of rules that can be hard to program, and the best way to program it changes based on what features
the language you are using provides you. It turned out to be both challenging and fun, and it tought me alot about the
language. After that I wanted to implement chess in other languages, to learn them and to see their differences.

## Chess in Java
[This was originally an assignment][java] in object oriented programming. The task was actually to implement Tic-tac-toe,
[Sokoban][], or a game of my choosing with similar complexity to those. I, of course, made a chess game. This time I used
JavaFX for the visual representation of the game, because that's what they tought in the course, and I thought it would be
nice to have some experience with it. Ultimatly I didn't need it at all, but it's nice to have learnt it anyway.

# Current projects

## Bispehaugen.no
[This is the website][buk] for the marching/concert band I'm playing in.
When I joined the marching band in the autumn of 2016 I was the only one
there that knew anything about websites, so I was immediately promoted to website developer and sysadmin. Since then I've
made some improvements to the old PHP-based site, and started to make the whole thing again from scratch in [Django][].
The project for the new website can be found [here][buk-django], and a developer guide and documentation (in norwegian)
[here][buk-wiki].

# Plans for the future
This is my plans for future projects. Some are fun small side-projects, while other are large and may take years.

## More chess
Of course I'm planning to implement chess in many other languages, to see what they can do.
Currently I'm planning to do it in python, c/c++, javascript (web version), Go, and maybe in app form for Android and iOS.

## Escape room
I'll continue to work on the escape room, and I'll be making many more puzzles. I want to try to go out of my comfort zone,
and learn something about an area I have no previous knowledge of.

## Building my own computer
This is my most ambitious and long-term plan. I want to build a computer, from scratch using only logic gates and such, and
write an operating system for it. I'm very interested in the inner workings of computers and low level computer electronics,
and I think this is just the right project learn all of that.
